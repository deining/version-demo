Hinode is available as a [template](https://github.com/gethinode/template), and a [main theme](https://github.com/gethinode/hinode). The template uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to link to the latest available version of the Hinode theme. As such, it is less applicable if you plan to customize a lot. Vice versa, the main theme allows for heavy customization, but is not synchronized with the latest available Hinode theme automatically.
